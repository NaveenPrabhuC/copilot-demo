# Step 1: Create a new folder named 'client' in the project root.
# All frontend-related files should be placed inside this folder.

# Step 2: Build a user interface using React that includes:
# - A dropdown or selection list for days of the week.
# - A dropdown or selection list for airports.

# Step 3: When the user selects a day and an airport:
# - Call the backend API endpoint created earlier, passing the selected day_of_week_id and airport_id as parameters.
# - Fetch the flight delay probability and confidence score from the API.

# Step 4: Display the API response clearly to the user in the UI,
# showing the chance of delay and confidence percentage.

# Please generate complete React code including:
# - Necessary imports and component setup
# - Functional components or hooks for managing state and effects
# - Dropdown components for user selections
# - API call logic with async/await and error handling
# - JSX for displaying results dynamically
# - Basic styling for a clean, user-friendly interface

# Place all files inside the 'client' folder.
